Alphalens is a Python Library for performance analysis of predictive (alpha) stock factors. Alphalens works great with the Zipline open source backtesting library, and Pyfolio which provides performance and risk analysis of financial portfolios. You can try Alphalens at Quantopian -- a free, community-centered, hosted platform for researching and testing alpha ideas. Quantopian also offers a fully managed service for professionals that includes Zipline, Alphalens, Pyfolio, FactSet data, and more.

The main function of Alphalens is to surface the most relevant statistics and plots about an alpha factor, including:

Returns Analysis
Information Coefficient Analysis
Turnover Analysis
Grouped Analysis
Getting started
With a signal and pricing data creating a factor "tear sheet" is a two step process:

import alphalens

# Ingest and format data
factor_data = alphalens.utils.get_clean_factor_and_forward_returns(my_factor,
                                                                   pricing,
                                                                   quantiles=5,
                                                                   groupby=ticker_sector,
                                                                   groupby_labels=sector_names)
